CI configuration
================

IDS-validator uses `ITER Bamboo <https://ci.iter.org/>`_ for CI. This page provides an overview
of the CI Plan and deployment projects.

CI Plan
-------

The `IDS-validator CI plan <https://ci.iter.org/browse/IC-PYM>`_ consists of 3 types of jobs:

Linting 
    Run ``black``, ``flake8``, ``mypy`` and ``isort`` on the IDS-validator code base.
    See :ref:`code style and linting`.

    The CI script executed in this job is ``ci/linting.sh``.

Testing
    This runs all unit tests with pytest.

    The CI script executed in this job is ``ci/run_pytest.sh``, which expects the
    modules it needs to load as arguments.

Build docs
    This job builds the Sphinx documentation.

    The CI script executed in this job is: ``ci/build_docs_and_dist.sh``, which expects the
    modules it needs to load as arguments.


Deployment projects
-------------------

There is currently one Bamboo deployment project for IDS-validator:

`Deploy IDS-Validator-Doc <https://ci.iter.org/deploy/viewDeploymentProjectEnvironments.action?id=1908899843>`_
    Deploy the documentation created in the `Build docs` job to `Sharepoint
    <https://sharepoint.iter.org/departments/POP/CM/IMDesign/Code%20Documentation/IDS-Validator/index.html#>`_.

    This deployment project runs for after each successful CI build of the IDS-validator main
    branch.
